        <p>Damien's anxiety has taken over, his descides to keep it a secret. Whenever his family calls him by Destiney, he would cringe and try to cover his ears, sometimes not respond. He distracts himself by watching anime, playing video games, or taking a long walk outside he house to get away from it. He look to his right and sees a group of friends sitting on a bench. He notices a rainbow looking flag and what seems to be a trangender flag. "It's seems like they support LQBTQ+ as well, one of them looks like a transgender, who looks as though he went through the process of testosterone and top-surgery" Damien says to himself. What should he do next?</p>
