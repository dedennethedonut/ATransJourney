			<p>After a moment of silents, Damien looks at his Mom and notices that she begins to cry. He asks her if she's ok, she says yes, then goes to him and gives him a hug, then his dad, sister and brother gives him a hug as well. His mom looks at him and tells him that she's proud of him and that she'll love him no matter what, his Dad tells him the he loves his new son, his sibilings support him also and they'll try to get use to the fact that they have a brother and not a sister. His Mom and Dad help him out by getting a binder, so his chest is flat, sign him up for testostorne to deepen his voice and have border shoulders, and sign him up for surgery to remove his breast. Damien is happier than ever to have his family support him. </p>

        	<p>Damien decides to go up to the group of friends sitting on a bench at a park. They notice him walking up to them, he's shy, he says hi to them and tells them that he's trans himself. The other trans kid comes to him and wants to how his family reacted, Damien tells him he hasn't and that he's scared to tell them. The kids tell him to join them and wants to know more about him. Damien tells his story, they tell their stories, and now Damien has made new friends and now feels a bit confident to know that he's not the only one who goes through it. He feels better revealing his secret to people who are more open-minded about the LGBTQ+ community and not having to keep the secret for a longtime. He now spends time with his new friends.</p>
