        <p>Damien has made a decision, he's going to gather his family and come out as trangender, he's nervous but he has no choice. His Mom and Dad are in the living room, watching TV, Damien takes a deep and walks up to them. "Is everything ok sweetie?" said Mom, "You look like you're gonna have a panic attack" Dad says as Damien starts to sweat. "I need to talk you, it's really important" says Damien, feeling more nervous than ever. Mom calls his older sister and younger brother, "Beatrice! Jason! Destiney has something important to tell us!" Everyone gathers on the couch, Damien takes one last deep breathe. "Listen, I have always felt like I'm different from other girls, I feel I'm different from Beatrice", Damien points at her, everyone looks at her, "What?" yells Beatrice. "Well, when you were younger, you'll never wanted to play dress up with Beatrice, but you'll always play cars with Jason" Mom says as she remembers. "Not only that, but you will always be at the boys section when we buy clothes, we would pull away but you'll always cry and have a tantrum" Dad adds on. "Anyway, I want you guys to do me a HUGE favor" Damien starts to shake. "Sure anything you want" says Mom and Dad. "Don't call me Destiney anymore....call me... Damien.... and use....he/him....pronouns...please" Damien begins to studder and cry at the same time. "Why?" says Jason as he looks like Mom and Dad. "Because.....because" slight pause. "Because...I WANT TO BE A BOY. I DON'T FEEL LIKE A NORMAL FEMALE. I WANT TO BE A BOY LIKE JASON SO I GROW TO BE A MAN LIKE DAD. THIS WILL MAKE ME HAPPY AND I NEED YOUR SUPPORT!!!....please", shouts Damien, everyone is silent and shocked by this news. How should they react? </p>
