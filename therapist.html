When he tries to ask if everyone is ok, he gets interupted by his father's yelling for him to stop talking. Mom thinks Damien had betrayed her even though he didn't, it's not like he's drinking alcohol or doing dangerous drugs. Then everyone starts a very intense argument about how everyone is against Damien being transgender. After the intense and detailed argument, Damien blows out his anger out and calls his family very detailed and gruesome names.

				<p>Since Damien descides to go home, not make new friends, and not tell his family he's trans, he begins to feel very tense, especially when his family calls him by his birthname. He tries to distract himself as much as possilbe to not think about it, but it's taken over him to the point where it's almost taken his sanity. So he descides to go see a therapist, without letting his family know. After school, he tells his mom that he's going to an after school program, but really he's going to a therapist, lucky none of his sibilings go to his school, so he can get away with it. After along time of seeing his therapist, he descides to move after he gradurates from school, starts wearing a binider, and takes testostorne without anybody knowing.</p>
